A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes the UniFi Network Controller API today and is evolving into a production-grade multi-domain platform for Protect, Access, and enterprise-scale orchestration.

See `SPEC.md` for the architecture target and `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` for the phase roadmap.

## Operator quick start

### Objective

Give operators a fast, safe reading order for understanding what the server does today, what it is becoming, and which docs govern rollout decisions.

### Prerequisites

- You know which UniFi API mode the deployment uses: local, cloud-ea, or cloud-v1.
- You know whether the runtime is stdio, HTTP, SSE, or streamable HTTP.
- You have read the phase target in `SPEC.md` and the current work item in `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`.

### Procedure

1. Confirm the current stable release and current phase focus.
2. Read `SPEC.md` for architecture intent and `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` for sequencing.
3. Use `API.md` and `docs/UNIFI_API.md` for implementation surface details.
4. Use the phase runbooks in `NETWORK_PLAYBOOK.md`, `HARBOR_SETUP.md`, `MULTI_CONTROLLER.md`, `METRICS.md`, `WEBHOOK_SETUP.md`, and `A2A.md` when operating or extending phase 5 systems.
5. For release work, consult `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` and `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` before tagging or publishing.

### Verification

- The chosen API mode matches the runtime configuration.
- The current phase and the documented roadmap agree.
- The operator can point to the correct runbook before making a change.

### Rollback

- If the selected runbook does not match the deployed capability, stop and reconcile docs before changing production state.

### Common failure modes

- README claims outrun the codebase.
- Operators follow phase language without checking the specific runbook.
- Release or rollout decisions are made from the README alone instead of the canonical docs.

## 🌐 API Mode Support

The UniFi MCP Server supports **three distinct API modes** with different capabilities:

### Local Gateway API (Recommended) ✅

**Full feature support** - Direct access to your UniFi gateway.

- ✅ **All Features Available**: Device management, client control, network configuration, firewall rules, WiFi management
- ✅ **Real-time Data**: Access to live device/client statistics and detailed information
- ✅ **Configuration Changes**: Create, update, delete networks, VLANs, firewall rules, SSIDs
- 📍 **Requirement**: Local network access to your UniFi gateway (e.g., 192.168.2.1)
- ⚙️ **Configuration**: `UNIFI_API_TYPE=local` + `UNIFI_LOCAL_HOST=<gateway-ip>`

### Cloud Early Access API ⚠️

**Site-centric access** - UniFi cloud API with limited but functional read-only capabilities.

- ✅ **Site Management**: List sites, get site details (matches by `siteId`, `_id`, `name`, or `meta.name`)
- ✅ **Site Manager API** (optional): Multi-site aggregation, host inventory, cross-site statistics
  - Enable with `UNIFI_SITE_MANAGER_ENABLED=true`
  - Gracefully degrades when endpoints are unavailable
- ⚠️ **No Individual Device/Client Access**: Cannot query specific devices or clients
- ⚠️ **No Configuration Changes**: Cannot modify networks, firewall rules, or settings
- ⚙️ **Configuration**: `UNIFI_API_TYPE=cloud-ea` + optional `UNIFI_SITE_MANAGER_ENABLED=true`
- 📊 **Rate Limit**: 100 requests/minute

### Cloud V1 API ⚠️

**Limited to aggregate statistics** - UniFi stable v1 cloud API.

- ✅ **Site Information**: List sites with aggregate statistics (device counts, client counts, bandwidth)
- ⚠️ **No Individual Device/Client Access**: Cannot query specific devices or clients
- ⚠️ **No Configuration Changes**: Cannot modify networks, firewall rules, or settings
- ⚙️ **Configuration**: `UNIFI_API_TYPE=cloud-v1`
- 📊 **Rate Limit**: 10,000 requests/minute

**💡 Recommendation**: Use **Local Gateway API** (`UNIFI_API_TYPE=local`) for full functionality. Cloud APIs are suitable only for high-level monitoring dashboards.

## 🔌 Transport Modes

The UniFi MCP Server supports **multiple transport modes** for different deployment scenarios:

### STDIO (Default) ✅

**Local subprocess communication** — Best for Claude Desktop, Cursor, and local AI clients.

- ✅ **Default mode**: No configuration needed
- ✅ **Zero network overhead**: Direct stdin/stdout communication
- ✅ **No port required**: Runs as a subprocess of the MCP client
- ⚙️ **Configuration**: `MCP_SERVER_TRANSPORT=stdio` (default)

### SSE (Server-Sent Events) 🌐 ⚠️ Deprecated

**Network-accessible HTTP server** — legacy transport, kept for backward compatibility.

- ⚠️ **Known issue**: client proxies such as `mcp-remote` can send the first tool call before the SSE `initialize` handshake finishes, which the MCP SDK rejects with `Received request before initialization was complete` (see [#96](https://github.com/enuno/unifi-mcp-server/issues/96)). This is a timing issue in the SSE transport itself (upstream in the `mcp` SDK / client proxy, not this server's tool logic), so it cannot be fixed from this codebase.
- ✅ **Network access**: Connect from any MCP client over HTTP
- ✅ **MCP gateway compatible**: Works with MCP gateways that consolidate servers
- ⚙️ **Configuration**: `MCP_SERVER_TRANSPORT=sse` + `MCP_SERVER_PORT=3000`
- 👉 **Prefer Streamable HTTP below** for any new network-accessible deployment.

### HTTP 🌐

**Standard HTTP transport** — Alternative network mode.

- ⚙️ **Configuration**: `MCP_SERVER_TRANSPORT=http` + `MCP_SERVER_PORT=3000`

### Streamable HTTP 🌐 ✅ Recommended for network access

**Modern HTTP transport** — the current MCP transport standard, and the successor to SSE.

- ✅ **Network access**: Connect from any MCP client over HTTP
- ✅ **MCP gateway compatible**: Works with MCP gateways that consolidate servers
- ✅ **No SSE handshake race**: session initialization is part of the same request/response cycle, avoiding the class of timing issue SSE has with proxies like `mcp-remote`
- ⚙️ **Configuration**: `MCP_SERVER_TRANSPORT=streamable_http` + `MCP_SERVER_PORT=3000` + `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>`

> ⚠️ **Authentication is required for network transports.** The MCP endpoint exposes every
> registered tool, including destructive ones. `http`, `sse`, and `streamable_http` will refuse
> to start unless `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is set; clients then send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
> The server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default — terminate TLS and authenticate at a reverse proxy
> before widening `MCP_SERVER_HOST` to `0.0.0.0`.
>
> 🔐 **Optional Cloudflare Access layer:** when the server sits behind Cloudflare Access
> (e.g. a hosted deployment fronted by a Zero Trust application), set both
> `CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` (e.g. `yourteam.cloudflareaccess.com`) and `CF_ACCESS_AUD`
> (the application AUD tag, found in Zero Trust → Access → Applications → your app →
> Overview; comma-separate for several). Every HTTP request then also needs a valid
> `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` header, which Cloudflare injects — requests that bypass
> Cloudflare (e.g. hitting the origin's raw URL) get 403. Both variables must be set
> together, and bearer-token auth still applies on top.

**💡 Recommendation**: Use **STDIO** for local AI clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor). Use **Streamable HTTP** when running behind an authenticating MCP gateway or reverse proxy — prefer it over SSE, which is kept only for backward compatibility.

## 🧭 Tool Exposure Profiles

To reduce context-window bloat, the server will support named exposure profiles that register only the tools relevant to a given UniFi application area.

### Planned profiles

- `network` — network, switching, WiFi, DHCP, DNS, traffic, and client tools
- `protect` — cameras, NVRs, devices, views, events, talkback, and Protect workflows (read surfaces wired; PTZ/media streams still in progress)
- `access` — doors, readers, credentials, visitors, and access-control workflows
- `talk` — UniFi Talk devices, calls, lines, and telephony workflows
- `drive` — UniFi Drive storage, files, sharing, and drive workflows
- `read-only` — `get_*`, `list_*`, `stat_*`, and `search_*` tools only

### Intended behavior

- Keep the full tool surface available when no profile is selected
- Expose fewer tools per session so agents do not carry unrelated UniFi modules in context
- Make the server easier to use in application-specific deployments and focused agent workflows
- Pair with `UNIFI_PROFILE` so profile selection is explicit and repeatable

### Running in Streamable HTTP Mode (recommended for network access)

```bash
# Set transport to Streamable HTTP
export MCP_SERVER_TRANSPORT=streamable_http
export MCP_SERVER_PORT=3000
# Required — the server refuses to start a network transport without it
export MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# Start the server (binds to 127.0.0.1 by default)
unifi-mcp-server
# Server listening on 127.0.0.1:3000 via streamable_http
# Clients send: Authorization: Bearer $MCP_AUTH_TOKEN
```

### Docker Compose for Streamable HTTP Mode

```yaml
services:
  unifi-mcp:
    image: ghcr.io/enuno/unifi-mcp-server:latest
    environment:
      UNIFI_API_KEY: your-api-key
      UNIFI_API_TYPE: local
      UNIFI_LOCAL_HOST: 192.168.2.1
      MCP_SERVER_TRANSPORT: streamable_http
      MCP_SERVER_PORT: 3000
      MCP_SERVER_HOST: 0.0.0.0            # container-internal; keep the published port on loopback
      MCP_AUTH_TOKEN: ${MCP_AUTH_TOKEN}   # required — clients send Authorization: Bearer <token>
    ports:
      # Published on loopback; put an authenticating TLS proxy in front to expose it further.
      - "127.0.0.1:3000:3000"
```

### Connecting via MCP Gateway

Once running in Streamable HTTP mode, configure your MCP gateway to connect:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi": {
      "url": "http://your-server-ip:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Running in SSE Mode (deprecated)

SSE is kept for backward compatibility only — see the [transport modes](#-transport-modes) section above for why Streamable HTTP is preferred. To run it anyway:

```bash
export MCP_SERVER_TRANSPORT=sse
export MCP_SERVER_PORT=3000
unifi-mcp-server
# Server listening on 127.0.0.1:3000 via sse (MCP_AUTH_TOKEN required)
```

**Note**: For MCP client integration (Claude Desktop, etc.), see the [Usage](#usage) section below for the correct configuration without `-d` flag.

## Build from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**: Required for running the server
- **Git**: For cloning the repository
- **uv** (recommended) or **pip**: For dependency management
- **Docker** (optional): For containerized builds
- **Node.js & npm** (optional): For npm package publishing

### Development Build

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enuno/unifi-mcp-server.git
cd unifi-mcp-server
```

#### 2. Set Up Development Environment

**Using uv (Recommended):**

```bash
# Install uv if not already installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# Or on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

**Using pip:**

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# Or on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

**Using make:** the repository `Makefile` wraps the uv commands above, and every
target runs through the locked environment, so no activation is needed:

```bash
make install   # uv sync --frozen --extra dev
make hooks     # install the pre-commit and commit-msg hooks
make help      # list every target
```

#### 3. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy example configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your UniFi credentials
# Required: UNIFI_API_KEY
# Recommended: UNIFI_API_TYPE=local, UNIFI_LOCAL_HOST=<gateway-ip>
```

#### 4. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest tests/unit/ --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing

# View coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html  # macOS
# Or: xdg-open htmlcov/index.html  # Linux
```

The same checks CI runs are available as `make` targets: `make test`,
`make test-cov` (with the 80% coverage gate), `make lint`, `make format`,
`make security`, `make docs-coverage`, `make pre-commit`, and `make ci` to run
all of the blocking ones. `make typecheck` runs mypy, which CI does not block on
yet.

#### 5. Run the Server

```bash
# Development mode with MCP Inspector
uv run mcp dev src/main.py

# Production mode
uv run python -m src.main

# The MCP Inspector will be available at http://localhost:5173
```

### Production Build

#### Build Python Package

```bash
# Install build tools
uv pip install build

# Build wheel and source distribution
python -m build

# Output: dist/unifi_mcp_server-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
#         dist/unifi_mcp_server-0.2.0.tar.gz
```

#### Build Docker Image

```bash
# Build for current architecture
docker build -t unifi-mcp-server:0.2.0 .

# Build multi-architecture (requires buildx)
docker buildx create --use
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7 \
  -t ghcr.io/enuno/unifi-mcp-server:0.2.0 \
  --push .

# Test the image
docker run -i --rm \
  -e UNIFI_API_KEY=your-key \
  -e UNIFI_API_TYPE=cloud \
  unifi-mcp-server:0.2.0
```

### Publishing

#### Publish to PyPI

```bash
# Install twine
uv pip install twine

## Usage

### With Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

#### Option 1: Using PyPI Package (Recommended)

After installing via `pip install unifi-mcp-server`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi": {
      "command": "unifi-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "UNIFI_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "UNIFI_API_TYPE": "local",
        "UNIFI_LOCAL_HOST": "192.168.2.1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For cloud API access, use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi": {
      "command": "unifi-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "UNIFI_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "UNIFI_API_TYPE": "cloud-v1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Using uv with PyPI Package

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["unifi-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "UNIFI_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "UNIFI_API_TYPE": "local",
        "UNIFI_LOCAL_HOST": "192.168.2.1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Using Docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "UNIFI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here",
        "-e",
        "UNIFI_API_TYPE=cloud",
        "ghcr.io/enuno/unifi-mcp-server:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Do NOT use `-d` (detached mode) in MCP client configurations. The MCP client needs to maintain a persistent stdin/stdout connection to the container.

### With Cursor

Add to your Cursor MCP configuration (`mcp.json` via "View: Open MCP Settings → New MCP Server"):

#### Option 1: Using PyPI Package (Recommended)

After installing via `pip install unifi-mcp-server`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi-mcp": {
      "command": "unifi-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "UNIFI_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "UNIFI_API_TYPE": "local",
        "UNIFI_LOCAL_HOST": "192.168.2.1",
        "UNIFI_LOCAL_VERIFY_SSL": "false"
      },
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Using uv with PyPI Package

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["unifi-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "UNIFI_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "UNIFI_API_TYPE": "local",
        "UNIFI_LOCAL_HOST": "192.168.2.1"
      },
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Using Docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "--rm", "-i",
        "--name", "unifi-mcp-server",
        "-e", "UNIFI_API_KEY=your_unifi_api_key_here",
        "-e", "UNIFI_API_TYPE=local",
        "-e", "UNIFI_LOCAL_HOST=192.168.2.1",
        "-e", "UNIFI_LOCAL_VERIFY_SSL=false",
        "ghcr.io/enuno/unifi-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Notes:**

- Replace `UNIFI_API_KEY` with your actual UniFi API key
- For local gateway access, set `UNIFI_API_TYPE=local` and provide `UNIFI_LOCAL_HOST`
- For cloud API access, use `UNIFI_API_TYPE=cloud-v1` or `cloud-ea`
- After saving, restart Cursor to activate the server
- Invoke tools in the Chat sidebar (e.g., "List my UniFi devices")

### With Other MCP Clients

The UniFi MCP Server works with any MCP-compatible client. Here are generic configuration patterns:

#### Using the Installed Command

After installing from PyPI (`pip install unifi-mcp-server`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi": {
      "command": "unifi-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "UNIFI_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "UNIFI_API_TYPE": "local",
        "UNIFI_LOCAL_HOST": "192.168.2.1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using uvx (Run from PyPI without installation)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["unifi-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "UNIFI_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "UNIFI_API_TYPE": "local",
        "UNIFI_LOCAL_HOST": "192.168.2.1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using Python Module Directly

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["-m", "src.main"],
      "env": {
        "UNIFI_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "UNIFI_API_TYPE": "local",
        "UNIFI_LOCAL_HOST": "192.168.2.1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Using as a Claude Code Skill

The repo ships a `SKILL.md` and four categorized skill files in `skills/` that let AI agents load UniFi context on-demand — without keeping all 215+ tool definitions in the LLM context for every conversation.

#### Install the skill

```bash
# Personal skill (available in all Claude Code sessions)
cp SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/unifi.md

# Or install all four domain skills individually
cp skills/unifi-network.md   ~/.claude/skills/
cp skills/unifi-devices.md   ~/.claude/skills/
cp skills/unifi-security.md  ~/.claude/skills/
cp skills/unifi-system.md    ~/.claude/skills/
```

Once installed, Claude Code will automatically reference the skill when you ask about UniFi topics, without loading the full MCP server into every conversation.

#### Scoped MCP profiles (reduce context footprint)

You can run the MCP server with only the tools you need by setting `UNIFI_PROFILE`:

| Profile | Tools loaded | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `network` | Clients, VLANs, WiFi, DHCP, DNS, vouchers | Day-to-day network ops |
| `devices` | Inventory, control, ports, switching, topology | Hardware management |
| `security` | Firewall, ZBF, ACLs, VPN, content filtering | Security audits |
| `system` | Sites, backups, traffic flows, DPI, RADIUS | Monitoring & ops |
| `minimal` | Sites + clients + devices only | Quick checks |

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi-security": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["unifi-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "UNIFI_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "UNIFI_API_TYPE": "local",
        "UNIFI_LOCAL_HOST": "192.168.2.1",
        "UNIFI_PROFILE": "security"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See [docs/SKILLS.md](docs/SKILLS.md) for the full guide.
